# National Parks Tidy Tuesdays Design Contest

## Class Project
We decided to explore the #TidyTuesdays R community for our class project. We saw the dataset on National Parks and we decided this would be a good visualization we could expirment with as we try to improve and replicate visuals submitted by others.

### Critique

1) What are good design aspects?
-- Having a graphic that is displayed in high enough quality to discinquish all parts of a line or scatterplot is a sometimes overlooked point. Data Visualizations today are included on websites and presentaitons that will be seen on projectors, mobile devices, and even on tablets that change the color tempature of the monitor during different times of the day and night. So it is important for data visualizations to be easily legible for all these devices and use cases.
-- Another good design is to have a concern for the color blind and the color disadvantaged when choosing colors for a plot. GGplot will naturally choose distinct colors while maintaining the lightness of the color pallet the same. This is not the best design considering the assisability of the audience. The Okabe Ito pallet is a good example of a color pallet that is accessable

### Improvements
1) Add total hours charts

>Visits — defined as “a person in a park on a day” — are just one way to measure park usage. Total hours spent tell a different story. “Visitor hours are equally important when looking at impacts on facilities, roads, staffing, etc.,” Ziesler said. Total hours include overnight stays and better reflect intensity of use. By this metric, Grand Canyon and Yellowstone national parks had the highest recreational hours in 2015. Overall, total recreational hours are up 37 percent since 1979, while nonrecreational hours are about flat.
