# National Parks Tidy Tuesdays Design Contest

##Class Project
We decided to explore the #TidyTuesdays R community for our class project. We saw the dataset on National Parks and we decided this would be a good visualization we could expirment with as we try to improve and replicate visuals submitted by others.

### Improvements
1) Add total hours charts

>Visits — defined as “a person in a park on a day” — are just one way to measure park usage. Total hours spent tell a different story. “Visitor hours are equally important when looking at impacts on facilities, roads, staffing, etc.,” Ziesler said. Total hours include overnight stays and better reflect intensity of use. By this metric, Grand Canyon and Yellowstone national parks had the highest recreational hours in 2015. Overall, total recreational hours are up 37 percent since 1979, while nonrecreational hours are about flat.
